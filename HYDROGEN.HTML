Chemical PROPERTIES
<BR>
</font>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
Electronegativity (according to Pauling)=2.1 <br>
Isotopes = 3<br>
Atomic no. =1<br>
Diatomic gas<br>
Bond with metalloids and metals forming hydrides<br>
Hydrogen extracts its electron and emits the H+ ion upon oxidation.<br>
It can explode when exposed to sunlight in the mixture of chlorines and hydrogen gas<br>
500 °C is the combustion occurring temperature of the H2 gas also known as the auto ignition temperature of the hydrogen.<br>
Ultraviolet rays that are invisible to the naked eye are emitted by the pure hydrogen-oxygen flames.<br>
Forms compounds with most of the elements despite its stability<br>
Lose an electron to form a proton<br> 
Gain an electron to form a hydride ion or form a covalent bond or polar covalent electron-pair bond.<br>

Uses of hydrogen 
<BR>
</font>
Hydrogen is significantly used in the synthesis of ammonia.<br>
To extract fat, a huge amount of H2 is consumed during the catalytic hydrogenation.<br>
As rocket propellant by nuclear form energy, the hydrogen also gets consumed as rocket fuel when it is combined with oxygen.<br>
In internal combustion engines, the hydrogen is burnt in the form of fuel.<br>
Further used in the production of nitric acid and nitrogenous fertilizers.<br>
H2 is used in the preparation of a useful chemical, hydrogen chloride.<br>
