PROPERTIES
<BR>
</font>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
1)Boron is from metalloids and it’s symbol is (B). 
<BR>  
2) Boron’s atomic number is (5)
<BR>
3)Its electronegativity is(2.04).
<BR>    
4)Density of boron is ( 2.3 g.cm power-3)
<BR>         
5)Melting point of boron is ( 2,076 °C) 
<BR> 
6)Boiling point of boron is (2550°C)
<BR>  
7) electronic configuration of boron is ( 1s22s22p1). 
<BR>
8)Boron is used in the manufacture of glass and in fertilizers (boron is necessary for plant growth). 
<BR>                                            
9) Boron is also used in detergents and Pyrex glassware is a borosilicate glass introduced by Corning Glass Works in 1915; it is widely used in laboratories because it does not expand on heating as much as ordinary glass, and it is much more resistant to breaking.
<BR>                       
10)Boric acid is used in many insecticides
<BR>                                                                             
11)Boron can also form extremely hard materials with nitrogen and carbon; boron nitride, BN, is similar in strength and appearance to diamond, and is used as an abrasive.
<BR>
12) Boron is found as shiny black crystals, or as an amorphous brown powder..
<BR>                                        
13)The name of the element is derived from buraq, the Arabic word for borax.
<BR>
14)It is found in the Earth's crust at a concentration of 10 ppm, making it the 38th most abundant element.  
<BR>                                  
15) Boron has properties of both metals and nonmetals as it is a metalloid .
<BR>                                              
16) Boron also  conducts electricity at high temperatures; but at room temperature, is it an insulator. 
<BR>                                          
17)Many boron salts emit a green color when heated and boron is most commonly found in the form of boron-oxygen salts called borates, such as borax or sodium borate, Na2B4O7·10H2O (the number of coordinated water molecules can vary, depending on the source), and boric acid, H3BO3.
<BR>       
18)Borate salts are used in the refining of metals

<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
Boron does not react with air at room temperature. At higher temperatures, boron reacts with oxygen, forming boron(III)oxide, B2O3.

<font size="6" face="Arial" color="red">Reaction of boron with halogens</font>
<br>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
Boron reacts with the halogens fluorine, chlorine and bromine, forming the respective boron(III)trihalides.
