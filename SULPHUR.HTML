Sulfur is a yellow nonmetal, and is found in a variety of forms, ranging from a yellow powder to more crystalline structures. Sulfur can be mined in its elemental form near volcanoes and hot springs, and is mined from salt domes along the Gulf of Mexico, Poland, and Russia . Sulfur has been known in its elemental form since ancient times . Sulfuric acid is used in the production of phosphates for fertilizers, the removal of rust from iron, the production of explosives, paints, paper, detergents, dyes, in lead-acid car batteries, and many other uses.
 
Sulfuric acid has a high affinity for water, and is used as a dehydrating agent. Since sulfur is found in two amino acids , some sulfur is present in fossil fuels such as coal. This leads to the formation of acid rain, which is a serious environmental pollutant in some areas. Many compounds containing sulfur are bad news for the nose.
