<BR>

8-IT IS ATOMIC MASS=18.998403 G MOL'
<BR>                                            
9-DENISTY =`.8 '10' G.CM AT 20DEGREE C
<BR>                       
10-MELTING POINT IS AT -219.6 DEGREE C
<BR>

14-FLOURIN HAS AN ATOMIC NUMBER OF 9.  
<BR>                                  
15) Boron has properties of both metals and nonmetals as it is a metalloid .
<BR>                                              
16) Boron also  conducts electricity at high temperatures; but at room temperature, is it an insulator. 
<BR>                                          
17)Many boron salts emit a green color when heated and boron is most commonly found in the form of boron-oxygen salts called borates, such as borax or sodium borate, Na2B4O7·10H2O (the number of coordinated water molecules can vary, depending on the source), and boric acid, H3BO3.
<BR>       
18)Borate salts are used in the refining of metals
