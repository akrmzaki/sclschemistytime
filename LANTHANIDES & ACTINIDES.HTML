<font face="cooper" size="5" color="black">
Lanthanides are the rare earth elements of the modern periodic table . They are a series of chemical elements comprises the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic number 57-71 from Lanthanum through lutenium .

Lanthanides properties:
</font>
<br>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
1.	soft metals and can even be cut with a knife.<br>

2.	The elements have different reaction tendencies depending on basicity. Some are very reactive while some take time to react.<br>


3.	Lanthanides can corrode or become brittle if they are contaminated with other metals or non-metals.<br>

4.	They all mostly form a trivalent compound. Sometimes they can also form divalent or tetravalent compounds.<br>


5.	They are magnetic.<br>

6.	Moving from left to right across the period (increasing atomic number), the radius of each lanthanide 3+ ion steadily decreases. This is referred to as 'lanthanide contraction'.<br>


7.	High melting points and boiling points.<br>

8.	They are very active.<br>


9.	React with water to liberate hydrogen (H2), slowly in cold/quickly upon heating.<br>

10.	Lanthanides commonly bind to water.<br>


11.	React with H+ (dilute acid) to release H2 (rapidly at room temperature).<br>

12.	React in an exothermic reaction with H2.<br>


13.	Burn easily in air.<br>

14.	They are strong reducing agents.<br>


15.	Their compounds are generally ionic.<br>

16.	At elevated temperatures, many rare earths ignite and burn vigorously.<br>


17.	Most rare earth compounds are strongly paramagnetic.<br>

18.	Many rare earth compounds fluoresce strongly under ultraviolet light.<br>


19.	Lanthanide ions tend to be pale colors, resulting from weak, narrow, forbidden f x f optical transitions.<br>

20.	The magnetic moments of the lanthanide and iron ions oppose each other.<br>


21.	The lanthanides react readily with most nonmetals and form binaries on heating with most nonmetals.<br>

22.	The coordination numbers of lanthanides are high (greater than 6; usually 8 or 9 or as high as 12).<br>

23.	They have metallic luster.

Uses of lanthanides:
</font>
<br>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
1.	They are used as a catalyst in the manufacture of petroleum and synthetic products.<br>

2.	Ceria is used in lamps, magnets, lasers, motion picture projectors, and x-ray intensify screens.<br>

3.	Alloys of lanthanides are used in the instrumental steels, stainless steel , and heat resistance .<br>

4.	It is used for the metallothermic reaction.<br>

5.	Ceria salts are used in lead storage battaries.<br>

Actinides:
</font>
<br>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
They are a series encompasses the 15 metallic chemical elements with atomic numbers from 89-103 from Actinium through Lawrenthium .  </font>

Actinides properties:
</font>
<br>
<font size="6" face="Arial" color="black">
1.	All actinides share similar physical appearance; they are solids that emit a silver luster.<br>

2.	All actinides possess high densities, except for americium and thorium.<br>


3.	Actinides are electropositive elements; they tend to lose electrons to form positively charged species. This explains why their oxidation state is positive, +3.<br>

4.	Actinides are known to be soft and ductile solids that can be easily sliced with a knife.<br>

5.	Actinides are weakly attracted to external magnetic fields due to their nature in being paramagnetic.<br>


6.	These elements readily react with nonmetals.<br>

7.	They are radioactive elements.<br>


8.	All are radioactive. These elements have no stable isotopes.<br>

9.	Actinides are highly electropositive.<br>

10.	The metals tarnish readily in air. These elements are pyrophoric (spontaneously ignite in the air), particularly as finely divided powders.<br>

11.	Actinides are very dense metals with distinctive structures. Numerous allotropes can be formed—plutonium has at least six allotropes. The exception is actinium, which has fewer crystalline phases.<br>

12.	They react with boiling water or dilute acid to release hydrogen gas.<br>

13.	Actinide metals tend to be fairly soft. Some can be cut with a knife.<br>


14.	These elements are malleable and ductile.<br>

15.	All the actinides are paramagnetic.<br>

16.	All these elements are silver-colored metals that are solid at room temperature and pressure.<br>

17.	Actinides combine directly with most nonmetals.<br>

18.	The actinides successively fill the 5f sublevel. Many actinide metals have properties of both d block and f block elements.<br>

19.	Actinides display several valence states, typically more than the lanthanides. Most are prone to hybridization.<br>

20.	The actinides (An) may be prepared by reduction of AnF3 or AnF4 with vapors of Li, Mg, Ca, or Ba at 1100-1400 C.<br>
