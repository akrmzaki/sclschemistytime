1)It is a non -metal
<BR>
2)It is atomic number 7.
<BR>
3)It is the most abundant gas in the air with 78% by volume proportion.
<BR>
4)It is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless gas.
<BR>
5)It is slightly lighter than air.
<BR>
6)It is slightly soluble in water.
<BR>
7)It is a non-poisonous gas but animals die due to suffocation of nitrogen.
<BR>
8)It is non-combustible gas neither does it support burning.
<BR>
9)It is chemically inert under ordinary conditions.
<BR>
10)The greatest single commercial use of nitrogen is as a component in the manufacture of ammonia, subsequently used as fertilizer and to produce nitric acid.
<BR>
11)Liquid nitrogen (often referred, to as LN2) is used as a refrigerant for freezing and transporting food products  for the preservation of bodies and reproductive cells (sperm and eggs), and for stable storage of biological samples.
<BR>
12)Nitrogen is an essential element for life, because it is a constituent of DNA and,  as such, is part of the genetic code.
<BR>
13)it can change the composition of species due to susceptibility of certain organisms to the consequences of nitrogen compounds.
<BR>
14)Food that is rich in nitrogen compounds can cause the oxygen  transport of the blood to decrease, which can have serious consequences for cattle.
<BR>
15)Nitrogen blanketing is used to protect flammable or explosive solids and liquids from contact with air.
<BR>
16) It is  surfaces of solids.
<BR>
17) It is stored food products have properties that must be protected from degradation by the effects of atmospheric oxygen and moisture. 
<BR>
18Liquid nitrogen can be used to freeze soft or tough substances prior to their entering a size reduction process. 
<BR>
19) Cold vaporized nitrogen can be used to keep materials cool (and in an inert atmosphere) during grinding.
<BR>
20)Nitrogen is used to treat the melt in the manufacture of steel and other metals and as a shield gas in the heat treatment of iron, steel and other metals.
<BR>
21)  It is  used as a process gas, together with other gases for reduction of carbonization and nitriding.
<BR>
22)Liquid nitrogen is used to cool concrete while it being poured and setting up.  Slower curing leads to better cured properties.
<BR>
23)Cold nitrogen gas is used to cool reactors filled with catalyst during maintenance work. The cooling time can be reduced substantially.
<BR>
24) Liquid nitrogen is often used to provide the necessary refrigeration as it can produce rapid temperature reduction and can then easily maintain the desired cold reaction temperatures .
<BR>
25)The liquid nitrogen is vaporized in specially-designed heat exchangers that transfers refrigeration to the circulating heat transfer fluid .
<BR> 
26)Nitrogen is used an inert gas to push liquids though lines, to clear lines and to propel "pigs" through pipelines to sweep out one material before using the line to transport another material.

<BR>
NH→NO N + 2HO (first heating is required, then the vessel is cooled down during the reaction, as the process takes place with the release of a great amount of heat up to kJ). The nitrogen is contaminated with impurities – nitrogen oxides and ammonia. Nitrogen can also be obtained in the thermal decomposition of ammonia and nitrogen (I) oxide:
<BR>
1.2NH → N + 3H;
<br>
2.2NO → 2N + O.
<BR>
Purer molecular nitrogen can be obtained in the decomposition of azides, and in passing ammonia over copper (II) oxide:
<BR>
•2NaN → 2Na + 3N;
<BR>
Nitrogen displays all oxidation states from -3 to +5: -3, -2, -1, 0, +1, +2, +3, +4, +5. Compounds in which nitrogen has the lowest oxidation state display typically reducing properties, while compounds with nitrogen in the highest oxidation state are strong oxidizers. Other compounds, depending on the second reagent or conditions of the re-action may displa oxidation-reduction duality – display both oxidation and reduction properties (this is especially characteristic for nitrogen (III) oxide).
<BR>
Examples of compounds in which nitrogen displays different oxidation states:
<BR>
•NH, NHCl, CaN – oxidation state -3 (ammonia, ammonium salts, nitrides);
<BR>
•NH – oxidation state -2 (hydrazine);
<BR>
•NHOH – oxidation state -1 (hydroxylamine);
<BR>
•N – oxidation state 0 (molecular nitrogen);
<BR>
•NO – oxidation state +1 (nitrogen (I) oxide);
<BR>
•NO – oxidation state +2 (nitrogen (II) oxide);
<BR>
•NO, HNO, NaNO – oxidation state +3 (nitrogen (III) oxide, nitrous acid, nitrites);
<BR>
•NO – oxidation state +4 (nitrogen (IV) oxide)
<BR>
•NO, HNO, KNO – oxidation state +5 (nitrogen (V) oxide, nitric acid, nitrates).
<BR>
•reaction with hydrogen with heating (from 500 ᵒC or 932 ᵒF and higher depending on the requirements for the speed of reaction and output), high pressure (around 350 atmospheres) and in the presence of a catalyst (for example, Fe or FeO):
<BR>
N + 3H →2NH;
<BR>
•reaction with oxygen with formation of nitrogen (II) oxide:
<BR>
N + O → 2NO (selective reaction, takes place with heating);
<BR>
•reaction with metals with heating (apart from lithium, which reacts with it at room temperature):
<BR>
3Ca + N → CaN (calcium nitride forms);
<BR>
6Li + N → 2LiN (lithium nitride forms);
<BR>
•reaction with boron at high temperature:
<BR>
2B + N → 2BN;
<BR>
•reaction with calcium carbide at 1000 ᵒC (1832 ᵒF):
<BR>
CaC + N → CaCN + C;
<BR>
•reaction with acetylene:
<BR>
СН + N → 2HCN (takes place in a condensed dis-charge);
<BR>
•reaction with sodium carbonate and coal with heating:
<BR>
2NaCO + 8C + 2N → 4NaCN + 6CO;
<BR>
•reaction with hot coal:
<BR>
2C + N → (CN) (dicyanogen forms);
<BR>
•reaction with fluorine with heating (or with an elec-trical discharge):
<BR>
N + 3F → 2NF (nitrogen fluoride forms).

<BR>
With other halogens and sulfur nitrogen does not react (sulfides and halogenides are obtained indirectly). Nitrogen does not react with acids, alkalis or water.
